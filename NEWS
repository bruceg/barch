Changes in version 0.6

- Renamed --snapshot to --listed-incremental and added -G option to make
  the incremental mode specification identical to that of tar.

- Added --differential mode, which works identically to
  --listed-incremental but without updating the listing file.

- Fixed a bug in incremental backups where excluded files would still be
  listed (but not recorded) in the archive.

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in extracting incremental backups.

- Added --remove-files option.

- Added full support for extracting device nodes.

Changes in version 0.5

Since the last release, barch has been completely rewritten in C
(instead of C++).  The resulting source is cleaner and easier to develop
(not to mention at least slightly more efficient).  The resulting
program is also more feature complete, and less of a prototype work.
