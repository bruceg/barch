Version @VERSION@
@TODAY@

This package contains an archiver, similar to tar, but designed
specifically to improve on some of the deficiencies that tar has.

Right now the implementation is pretty bare bones, but it is being
released as a kind of "proof of concept" in the hopes of getting some
feedback on the concepts and/or preliminary implementation.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.
